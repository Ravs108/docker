# Do the following
1. Display Hello World on the console
2. Take two numbers as input. Among them display the bigger and smaller number.
3. Calculator. Take input of 2 numbers. For these two numbers, display sum, subtraction, multiplication and division by the smaller number.
4. Advance Calculator. Write a program to do square and square root of a number.
5. Odd or even: Write a program to determine if a number is odd or even
6. Prime number: Write a program to determine if a number is prime or not
7. Find the largest among 3 numbers. Take 3 different number and determine which of tehem is the largest and print the number.
8. Grade calculator. Assign a Alphabetical grade to the given student marks. Example: A: 90- 100 B: 80 - 89 C: 70-79 D: 60 - 69 F: Below 60
9. Counting Up: Use a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to 100. (Focus: for loop structure).
10. Sum of Numbers: Use a loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 500. (Focus: Accumulator Variable inside a loop).

Level 4: Functions and Simple Data Structures ðŸ§±
These introduce reusable code blocks and basic data organization.

Function to Add: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Call the function and print the result. (Focus: Function Definition, Parameters, and Return Values).

List/Array Printer: Create a list or array of five items (e.g., names, colors, fruits). Use a loop to print each item in the list. (Focus: Data Structures and Looping over them).

Factorial: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a user-input number (e.g., Factorial of 5 is 5Ã—4Ã—3Ã—2Ã—1). This combines loops and functions. (Focus: Complex Loop Logic).

Reversing a String: Write a function that takes a word as input and prints the word backward (e.g., "code" becomes "edoc"). (Focus: String Indexing and Loops).
